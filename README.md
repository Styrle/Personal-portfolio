### Bin monitor
This application was created during my second year of university and involved my first interaction with react.js. For this project I worked in a team to create a Arduino which would monitor a bins capacity and then be able to display this data using a web app, the idea being a waste management team would know which bins where full and even calculate which bins would need to be emptied more than once a day.
